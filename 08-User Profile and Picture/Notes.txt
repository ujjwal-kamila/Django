If you have error 405 page on logout page it may be due to latest django version this is what I did to get round it. In users views folder i put this code 
from django.contrib.auth import logout
def logout_view(request):
    logout(request)
    return render(request, 'users/logout.html')

then in main project urls I put this in urr parttern list
path("logout/", user_views.logout_view, name="logout"),

You can comment out the former url path of logout
